My patches for [tabbed](tabbed.suckless.org).

#### `tabbed-autohide-20170228-bc23614.diff`

Updated (and modified) `tabbed-0.5-autohide.diff`.
The visual result is the same, the implementation adds/removes the bar on `{,un}manage` though.

#### `tabbed-keep-cwd-20170228-bc23614.diff`

Use cwd of the process in the current tab when spawning a new process.
